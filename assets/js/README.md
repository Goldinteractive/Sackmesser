## JS Structure

### `js/main.js`

The `main.js` is the starting point of the app, which will initialize all the fancy stuff.
A bundled version (`main.bundle.js`) will be generated with the `make js` or `make watch-js` and used in development and production environments.

### `js/features`

In this folder, you will find the site feature classes.

### `/.docs`

To (re)generate this documentation, use `make jsdoc`.
